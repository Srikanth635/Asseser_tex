\section*{Flaw Analysis and Prioritization}

\subsection*{Flaw 1: Lack of Clarity on Optimization Methods}
\textbf{Description}: The proposal mentions the use of numerical optimization methods like Newton or quasi-Newton but does not detail the selection criteria or the condition for which method to use. \\
\textbf{Severity}: Moderate \\
\textbf{Priority}: High \\
\textbf{Recommendations}: Provide detailed criteria for selecting the optimization method. Include potential scenarios and justifications for using one method over another.

\subsection*{Flaw 2: Intractability of Exact Learning}
\textbf{Description}: It is noted that exact learning is intractable for all but the smallest examples, but there is no discussion on approximate methods or alternatives to handle larger datasets. \\
\textbf{Severity}: Critical \\
\textbf{Priority}: High \\
\textbf{Recommendations}: Discuss approximate learning techniques or other strategies to handle intractability in larger datasets.

\subsection*{Flaw 3: Fixed Random Variables in PGMs}
\textbf{Description}: The fixed nature of random variables in probabilistic graphical models limits expressiveness, yet there are no suggested solutions or alternatives presented. \\
\textbf{Severity}: Moderate \\
\textbf{Priority}: Medium \\
\textbf{Recommendations}: Explore and discuss alternative models that allow for variable random variables, such as Probabilistic Relational Models.
