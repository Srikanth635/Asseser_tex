**Objective**: Assess the proposal for the Collaborative Research Centre
(CRC) initiative focusing on EASE using criteria derived from the
funding agency's description of CRCs and the review criteria for renewal
proposals. The report should provide ratings, detailed evaluations, and
actionable recommendations for improvement. The output must be a **LaTeX
document** with the following specifications:
- **Font**: 11pt Helvetica.
- **Page Style**: Full-page margins using the `fullpage` package.
- **Sections**: Organized with `\section` and `\subsection` headings.
- **Tables**: Summarize key findings and ratings in a formatted table.
- **Lists**: Use LaTeX's `itemize` environment for bullet points to
present strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations.

### **Assessment Criteria**

Evaluate the proposal based on these criteria, derived from CRC
guidelines and review standards:

1. **Research Quality and Impact**:
    - Does the proposal address a timely, original, and ambitious
research topic?
    - Does it demonstrate a high scientific standard with a focus on
long-term goals and international visibility?
    - Are preliminary results or past achievements effectively leveraged
to build credibility?

2. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Coherence**:
    - Is there evidence of meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration?
    - Are the research projects well-integrated, with clear synergies
and added value from cooperation across disciplines?
    - Does the CRC structure (projects, areas, leadership) support
coherence and collaboration?

3. **Institutional Support and Strategic Role**:
    - Does the proposal align with the host institution’s strategic
goals and benefit from strong institutional backing (e.g., resources,
infrastructure)?
    - Is there evidence of coordination between participating
institutions or international collaborations?

4. **Support for Early-Career Researchers**:
    - Are structured programs and mentorship opportunities in place to
foster the development of young researchers?
    - Does the proposal promote academic independence and career growth
for early-career scientists?

5. **Equality and Inclusion**:
    - Are measures for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion
described and effectively implemented?
    - Does the proposal outline specific initiatives for gender equality
or accessibility?

6. **Management and Knowledge Dissemination**:
    - Are management structures and processes clearly outlined and
effective in ensuring quality and transparency?
    - Does the proposal address data management, public outreach, and
knowledge transfer effectively?

7. **Sustainability and Long-Term Vision**:
    - Does the CRC demonstrate a compelling long-term vision for its
research?
    - Are strategies in place to ensure sustainability (e.g., funding
continuity, data management plans)?
    - Does the proposal align research outcomes with societal and
academic needs?

### **Output Requirements**

1. Assign a **numerical rating (1–10)** for each criterion.
2. Provide **detailed evaluations** for each criterion:
    - Highlight strengths and weaknesses observed.
    - Identify areas needing improvement or clarification.
    - Offer actionable recommendations for improvement.
3. Summarize ratings and key findings in a **LaTeX table**.
4. Structure the report as a **LaTeX document**:
    - Use `\section` and `\subsection` for headings.
    - Include bullet points (`itemize`) for evaluations and recommendations.
    - Summarize ratings and observations in a formatted table using
`\tabular`.
